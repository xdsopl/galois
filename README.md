# Galois Field Implementations in Swift

This repository provides implementations of Galois fields in Swift, along with examples showcasing the usage of Galois fields in erasure coding algorithms. Galois fields, also known as finite fields, are mathematical structures that are widely used in various areas of computer science and cryptography.

## Prerequisites

- Swift programming language

## Galois Field Implementations

The repository includes implementations of different types of Galois fields, such as:

- Galois fields of characteristic 2 (GF(2^n))
- Prime fields (GF(p))

These Galois field implementations support arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.

## Examples

The examples provided in this repository are primarily intended to showcase the usage of Galois fields, rather than providing full-fledged erasure coding implementations. They serve as illustrations of how Galois fields can be utilized in erasure coding algorithms.

### Cauchy Reed-Solomon Erasure Codes

The Cauchy Reed-Solomon codes example (`cauchy.swift`) demonstrates the usage of Galois fields for encoding and decoding messages using Cauchy Reed-Solomon erasure codes. It showcases how to simulate erasures, generate code words, and recover the original messages using Cauchy inverse and matrix operations.

### Lagrange Interpolation Erasure Coding

The Lagrange interpolation-based erasure coding example (`lagrange.swift`) demonstrates how to encode and decode messages using Lagrange interpolation and Galois field arithmetic. It showcases the generation of redundant symbols, simulation of erasures, and the recovery of the original messages using Lagrange interpolation algorithms.

## Test Bench

The `testbench.swift` file provides a test bench for running the Galois field implementations. It includes test cases to verify the correctness of the arithmetic operations in different Galois fields.

To run the test bench:

1. Open the `testbench.swift` file.
2. Uncomment the desired Galois field type (`GF8`, `GF16`, or `PrimeField<PrimeNumber257>`).
3. Optional: Generate Galois field tables if required (uncomment the corresponding table generation code).
4. Run the code to execute the test cases.
5. The console output will display the results of the test cases, including the arithmetic operations and their expected results.

Please note that the test bench focuses on testing the Galois field implementations themselves, rather than the specific erasure coding examples mentioned earlier.
